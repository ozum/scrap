# Description

### tslint.json

`tslint.json` is not a symbolic link. Although it is a "JSON" file, it is extendible. Since `src` would not be available in npm package, it is a real file in
root. It can be customized by creating a file in project root and adding below:

```json
{ "extends": "moe-scripts/tslint.json" }
```
